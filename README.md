# Queues

Lines. We all have been in them before. When they run properly, it makes everyone happy there is order and regulation in the world, but when they don't, people get frustrated, tired and impatient. 

Queues are the savior of waiting lines. They can ensure that one set of data is specifically next in line no matter how many other people hop in line. Everything has a place in the queue. 

Most queue operations have a performance of O(1) meaning that no matter the size of your queue you can get almost instant results. The operators that have this performance are appending to the queue (enqueue), getting the size of the queue (size()), checking if the queue is empty (empty()). The only exception is the dequeue which if your queue is larger will take longer to complete making it O(n).  

## Purposes and usage

Queues are a type of data structure that stores items First in First out. This means that the first item added into the queue will be processed first, and the last item added to the queue will be processed last. I like to relate this to being on hold with a company over the phone. There will most likely be a number of different callers calling into the company, but the person who is next in line will have their call answered first.





## Examples
